# DESCRIPTION: A user-friendly gdb configuration file, for x86/x86_64 and ARM platforms.
#
# REVISION : 8.0.2 (31/07/2012)
#
# CONTRIBUTORS: mammon_, elaine, pusillus, mong, zhang le, l0kit,
#               truthix the cyberpunk, fG!, gln
#
# FEEDBACK: http://reverse.put.as - reverser@put.as
#
# NOTES: 'help user' in gdb will list the commands/descriptions in this file
#        'context on' now enables auto-display of context screen
#
# MAC OS X NOTES: If you are using this on Mac OS X, you must either attach gdb to a process
#                 or launch gdb without any options and then load the binary file you want to analyse with "exec-file" option
#                 If you load the binary from the command line, like $gdb binary-name, this will not work as it should
#                 For more information, read it here http://reverse.put.as/2008/11/28/apples-gdb-bug/
#
# UPDATE: This bug can be fixed in gdb source. Refer to http://reverse.put.as/2009/08/10/fix-for-apples-gdb-bug-or-why-apple-forks-are-bad/
#         and http://reverse.put.as/2009/08/26/gdb-patches/ (if you want the fixed binary for i386)
#
#         An updated version of the patch and binary is available at http://reverse.put.as/2011/02/21/update-to-gdb-patches-fix-a-new-bug/
#
# iOS NOTES: iOS gdb from Cydia (and Apple's) suffer from the same OS X bug.
#  		 If you are using this on Mac OS X or iOS, you must either attach gdb to a process
#            or launch gdb without any options and then load the binary file you want to analyse with "exec-file" option
#            If you load the binary from the command line, like $gdb binary-name, this will not work as it should
#            For more information, read it here http://reverse.put.as/2008/11/28/apples-gdb-bug/
